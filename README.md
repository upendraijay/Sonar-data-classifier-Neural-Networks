# Sonar-data-classifier-Neural-Networks

This dataset consists of sonar data. The aim of this data is do distinguish between rocks and metal structures such as sea mines on the seafloor. The file 111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various conditions and 97 patterns obtained from rocks under similar conditions.

Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. The label associated with each record contains the letter "R" if the object is a rock and "M" if it is a mine (metal cylinder).
